	<p>For this project, I was required to take photos using compostion skills learned in class. Afterwards, I was required to edit 	the photos, document my changes, and then compile them in an Adobe InDesign file. Below you will find the orignal photo on the left and the edited version on the right, along with compostion or editing notes.</p>

	<td colspan="2" align="center" valign="top"><img src="SMCOriginal.jpg"><p>I captured this image of the Student Memorial Center 	about 120
	feet away from the tower. I attempted to use rule of thirds to split
	this image by having the tower on one side, and the trees on the
	other, with the street splitting the image. This image was taken
	during golden hour with no flash, and so the building appears
	more orange than how it was in reality. </p>

	<td colspan="2" align="center" valign="top"><img src="SMCEdited.jpg"><p>To compensate for the orange appearance, I lowered the
	brightness down by 20 units. I also used auto contrast to bring
	out the various colors in the sky. The main focus of this image
	is the sky, so making it look as best as possible was my main
	concern.</p>

	Hall. It was taken early in the morning and the skies were
	gray. The flash was not on, nor were my camera’s low light
	settings. I attempted to use the trees to frame McComsey
	Hall.</p>


	<td colspan="2" align="center"><img src="McComseyEdited.jpg"><p>In order to focus the building more, I turned the contrast
	up 10. This added definition to the bricks. I also used the
	clone stamp tool to remove the blue pole on the right. I
	increased the brightness by 30 to brighten the photo since
	it was taken early in the morning. Lastly, I used the auto
	tone, contrast, and color features.

	dorm. My roommate, Gabe, is the focus of the
	picture. He is standing about 10 feet away from
	the camera. I attempted to use leading lines in
	this picture to lead the viewer to him.</p>


	<td colspan="2" align="center" valign="top"><img src="GabeEdited.jpg"><p>First, I rotated the photo slightly because it
	was tilted when taken. Next, I used auto tone,
	contrast, and color. I turned up the contrast
	by 10 as well. Lastly, I used the clone stamp
	tool to edit out the room number on the
	sign. My goal was to take out the warmth of
	the lighting in the original photo because it
	did not properly reflect the LED lighting in
	the hall.</p>

	was about 8 inches away from the computer when I
	shot this photo. I used the worm’s eye perspective to
	try to give a different angle of the computer than humans are used to. There was medium lighting when
	this picture was taken. Some lights were on in the
	room. I did not use flash or low light settings when
	taking this picture.</p>


	<td colspan="2" align="center" valign="top"><img src="MacEdited.jpg"><p>The first thing I did was I increased the brightness
	by 41 to brighten up the computer. Next, I raised the
	contrast by 20. This really brought the computer out
	from the dark background. Then, I used the clone
	stamp tool to remove the reflection of the LED lights
	behind the camera onto the bezels of the computer.
	Lastly, I used the auto tone and contrast features.</p>
